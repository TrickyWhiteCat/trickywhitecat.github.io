Welcome! This is the very first entry on my new blog.

I'm using Jekyll as the static site generator and hosting it for free on GitHub Pages. Pretty cool!

## What's Next?

I plan to write about various topics, including:

* Web Development
* Technology Guides
* Maybe some personal updates

Stay tuned for more!
